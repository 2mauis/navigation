interface: 
    world model: get footprint cost
    inherited by:
        costmap_model: check footprint in costmap
        point_grid: check footprint, but more complex, need to see further
        voxel_grid: check footprint
        latter two maintain own obstacle grid, and point_grid has a main???
    
    trajectoryCostFunction: scoreTrajectory, and a scale field(used to combine each score func)
    inherited by:
        ...
        ...
        ...

    trajectorySampleGenerator: hasMoreTrajectories nextTrajectory
    inherited by:
    simple_trajectory_generator: for a few steps,select a velocity from all possible velocity,
        accelerate from current velocity until reaching target velocity.
        record trajectories of all, to score them later.

    trajectorySearch: findBestTrajectory
    inherited by:
    simple_scored_sampling_planner: scoreTrajectory to findBestTrajectory,
        combine all trajectoryCostFunction 

above is only used in dwa planner.
In base local planner(trajectory planner (ros)), all is coupled together

three parts: footprint/trajectory cost/trajectory generator and find best.
